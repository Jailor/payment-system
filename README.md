# Payment System :currency_exchange:

## About :thought_balloon:
For my internship project, my team was tasked to create a payment system that allows for payments between accounts and managing the user data of the application. I was also tasked with creating an enhancement to the payment system, and I chose to use machine learning in order to detect fraudulent payments.

## Features :white_check_mark:
The application has a complex flow, with lots of entities: accounts, users, profiles, customers and payemnts. Users can log in to the system, and each suer can have a profile. The profile determines what rights inside the system that specific user has. Entities can be viewed with a filter, and everything that happens inside the system is logged and audited. The systems also performs fraud detection using a neural network.
